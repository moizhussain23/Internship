- You'll receive an email notification
- Check status in WhatsApp Manager → Message Templates

### Step 6: Update Your Code (After Approval)

Once approved, I'll help you update the code to use these templates. The code will look like this:

```javascript
// Using template instead of custom body
const customerMessage = await client.messages.create({
  contentSid: 'HX...', // Template SID from Twilio
  from: `whatsapp:${twilioPhoneNumber}`,
  to: `whatsapp:${formatToE164(customerPhone)}`,
  contentVariables: JSON.stringify({
    "1": customerName,
    "2": formattedDate,
    "3": appointmentTime,
    "4": servicesList,
    "5": total.toString(),
    "6": paymentMethod === 'card' ? 'Paid' : 'Pay at appointment',
    "7": salonOwnerPhone
  })
});
```

---

### Step 7: Get Template SID from Twilio

After Meta approves your templates:
1. Go to https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/content-editor
2. Your approved templates will appear there
3. Click on each template to get the **Content SID** (starts with `HX...`)
4. Save these SIDs - you'll need them in the code

2. ⏳ Wait 24-48 hours for approval
3. 📝 Get Content SIDs from Twilio Console
4. 💻 I'll update your code to use the templates
